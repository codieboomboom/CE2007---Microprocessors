# CE2007 - Microprocessors

## Course Overview
This module has been revamped by SCSE NTU in AY19/20 with special details toward the Lab sessions to prepare its students better for the Embedded industry. Unlike previous syllabus where labs are surrounded the ARM Cortex M0 processor and emulation of this processor using FPGA, the new lab series are about Cortex M4F processor. Student get to learn about the basics of ARM microprocessors such as instruction set, effecient Embedded C programming,... 

The course logistics are as follow:
+ TI-RSLK Maze Edition Robot kit (provided by school)

+ Lab Src Template (provided on NTULearn)
+ TI Code Composer Studio IDE (provided by TI website)
+ TI-RSLK full syllabus, documentation and datasheets

*Do note that this course dwells with the bare-metal implementation of programs on the target architecture, in contrast to CE3003, which deals with RTOS implementation on the same microcontroller platform.*

## Lab & Assessment
The coursework program was adapted from the TI-RSLK University Program curriculum, however this should include enough concepts for students to work with any bare-metal system. The breakdown for labs and courseworks are as follow:

Lab 1: Introduction about Cortex M4F, ARM assembly, Embedded C programming, TI RSLK robot kit.

Lab 2: Introduction about GPIO and Interrupts in Cortex M4F.

Lab 3: Introduction about Timer Compare interrupt.

Lab 4: Introduction about Timer Capture interrup and ADC.

Lab 5: Assessment with Self-test program of the robot.

Assessment:
- All Lab handouts
- Lab 5 Self test program: basic 4 features + any add on. Highly advice to implement the most crazy things you can.


## This Repository
The repo can be navigated as following:
- Lab Manual and Handouts store the lab handouts that students are expected to submit after every lab session, based on what they learn in the lab session.
- Labxref_xxxx stores the reference code for every lab session. These modules serve as a guide of student on how to prototype certain things and are meant to be used for studying before lab.
- Labx-xxxx stores the source code for the lab sessions.
